CONFIGURING MYSQL

1. Create a database and a user that can access the database:

  mysql -u root -p
  > create database openid;
  > grant all on openid.* to openid_user'%';
  > set password for openid_user@'%' = PASSWORD('newpass');
  > flush privileges;
  > exit;

2. Run the file sql/mysql.sql to create the necessary tables in the database:

  mysql -u openid_user -p --database=openid < sql/mysql.sql

3. Create a user in the new application:

  mysql -u openid_user -p --database=openid
  > insert into users (username, password, created) values ('newuser', MD5('newpass'), NOW());
  > exit;

Obviously you should change 'newuser' to be the username that you want to use
and 'newpass' to the password you want to use.


CONFIGURING APACHE

This program requires three things from Apache:
  mod_perl enabled
  mod_ssl enabled
  libapreq2 enabled

These will *usually* be enabled as shared libraries. If that is the case, you
should see lines such as these in your Apache configuration file:

  LoadModule perl_module            modules/mod_perl.so
  LoadModule apreq_module           modules/mod_apreq2.so

This OpenID server requires that you give it its own root host, something such
as "http://id.example.com". This is because it will take over that host and
disallow you from running other things on it.

Configuring Apache is simple. Just take a look at the configuration example
for Apache under configuration/httd.conf. Change the contents of that file as
appropriate and copy its contents to your Apache configuration files.


CONFIGURING OPENID

Once you've done all that, modify the default OpenID configuration file,
called "default" to fill in your database username and password and the
hostname and timezone information.


OTHER NOTES

All users found in the database will have OpenID endpoints located here:

  http://id.example.com/username

Where id.example.com is the hostname you've given your OpenID server and
username is whatever username is being referenced. This will supply an HTML
endpoint and an XRDS endpoint.
